# Project Updates

This is based on a clone of the original site from 2024-02

It has been updated to:

> Update  Python to 3.11

> Switch to using paho-mqtt version 2

> Within the rtl2mqtt.py script, force the use of version 1 methods

## Future

I plan to review the project to use paho-mqtt version 2 commands set as they plan to deprecate version1 in version 3, however this isnt a quick fix being someone else's code who appears to no longer maintain it.

At least for now it works.

I also plan to add some filters so only specific device types will be seen
